The usual restore restores all Smart Home settings and compares the current state of the Z-Way network data with the stored ones and tries to heal failed nodes or incomplete interviews. The restored backup does NOT overwrite the existing Z-Way network configuration. If you want to restore a fully resetted controller or restore your Z-Way network to an older configuration, select the 'Restore Z-Way Network'check box.",
